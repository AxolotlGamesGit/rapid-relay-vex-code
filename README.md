# rapid-relay-vex-code
This was made for my catapult bot with a tensioner and pneumatics for China loading. I use code to make it switch the pneumatics and change the tension to hit both the high and low goal.

I started to make auton code for regionals, but I couldn't make it consistant without goal aligners. I didn't know we were making it to states until less than 2 weeks ago, so I haven't had time to add goal aligners or fix the code.
