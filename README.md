# rapid-relay-vex-code
This was made for our catapult bot with a tensioner and pneumatics for China loading. We use code to make it switch the pneumatics and change the tension to hit both the high and low goal.

We started to make auton code for regionals, but we couldn't make it consistant without goal aligners. We didn't know we were making it to states until less than 2 weeks ago, so we haven't had time to add goal aligners or fix the code.
