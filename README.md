# rapid-relay-vex-code
This was made for my catapult bot with a tensioner and very simple intake. I use code to make it carry a second ball and change the tension to hit both the high and low goal. If we have time, I might make it able to shoot a specific distance for direct passing between bots, but that depends on how accurate we can make it.
