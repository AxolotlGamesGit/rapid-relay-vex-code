# rapid-relay-vex-code
Idk why this is public. The code was rushed (impossible to tell, I know).

This was made for my catapult bot with a tensioner and very simple intake. I use code to make it carry a second ball and change the tension to hit both the high and low goal. If I have time, I might make it able to shoot a specific distance for direct passing between bots, but that depends on how accurate I can make it.
